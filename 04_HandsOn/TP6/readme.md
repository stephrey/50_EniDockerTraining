# TP6 docker services and stack
In this example, the first step is to create a service. 
Then you deploy a stack using a YAML file

---

## create a service
Create a service with 3 replicas base on the image "mon-site:1.0"
Update the replicas size, list the service and its process

## create and deploy a stack
Tag the image "mon-site:1.0" and register it on a registry. Create a docker-stack YAML file and difine the service.
Scale the services stack
